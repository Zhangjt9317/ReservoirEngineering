# The Reservoir Engineer's Toolbox
### Description
This is a set of useful function for reservoir engineers that I hope one day can grow into a comprehensive function library for reservoir engineers.

The library so far includes functions that I use in my daily work which at the moment is gas reservoir engineering.

Please feel free to contribute.

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Just fork the repository at: https://github.com/leytzher/ReservoirEngineering.git
and help me to make this a better library.

I chose Python to develop these functions because it is easy for everyone to get up to speed with Python and start contributing.

### Todo's
* Transient gas equation
* Boundary dominated gas equation
* Pseudopressure calculation
* Pseudotime calculation
* Simple material balance to calculate average pressure at each time step
* Gas volumetrics (GIIP)
* Interpolation routines for Blasingame type curves
* etc etc etc
